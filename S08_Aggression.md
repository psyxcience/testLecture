# Aggression

* based on Myers et al. Social Psychology (Chapter 8)

## Different Definitions
* Behavior that results in personal injury or destruction of property (Bandura, 1973)
* Behavior intended to harm another of the same species (Scherer et al, 1975)
* Behavior directed towards the goal of harming or injuring another living being who is motivated to avoid such treatment (Baron, 1977)

* **The intentional infliction of some form of harm on others (Baron & Byrne, 2000)**

## Two Kinds (+1)
**Reactive aggression**
* Aggression in response to being provoked.

**Instrumental aggression**
* Aggression in order to obtain a desired reward.

**(Aggression) Displacement**
* Excitation-transfer model

## Non-social Influences
* Genetics
* mice breeding
* monoamine oxidase-A

* Biochemical Influences
* Alcohol (disinhibition)
* Testosterone
* Serotonin

* Neural Influences (”self-control“)

## (Social) Roots of Aggression
Frustration
Learning
Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis
(Dollard et al., 1939)
Frustration
Feeling resulting from perceiving slow progress towards a goal

(Early) Hypothesis:
Frustration always leads to some form of aggression

Conclusion:
Yes, frustration often does increase the likelihood of showing aggression
(prepare for aggression)
No, of course not always

Frustration leading to aggression
Experimental example (Barker et al., 1941)
Room of attractive toys presented
Manipulation
Playing allowed versus playing prevented
Later playing of the prevention group showed more aggressive behaviors towards the toys compared to control group.

Field example (Brown et al., 2001)
British ferry travelers: Higher aggressive attitudes towards French people on days when French fishing boats blockade the ferry port
Frustration-Aggression Revised
Aggression following frustration is more likely if the disruption to a goal is
Intentional (& unjustified)
(e.g., disruption of group's problem solving task by someone not paying attention)

and less likely if it is unintentional (and/or justified)
(e.g., disruption of group's problem solving task by someone who's hearing aid is malfunctioning)

(Burnstein & Worchel, 1962)
Frustration from (relative) Deprivation
Relative deprivation:
The perception that one is less well off than others with whom one compares oneself
A general state of being not able to pursue one's goals

Sources:
Divide between rich and poor
Television

Again, justification is important
Aggression as Learned Behavior
Reinforcement
Observational learning
Aggression and Rewards
Experience or observation that aggression pays off
→ instrumental aggression
Social Learning Theory
Bandura (1961)
Social Learning Theory
Bandura (1961)
2-3 year old children
Distraction task while
observing
not observing
aggressive behavior of an adult
Those who observed the aggressive adult displayed more aggressive behavior in subsequent free play
Social Learning Theory

Additional factors
Nurturant versus non-nurturant adult
Nurturant adult → more imitation

Punished versus non-punished adult aggression
Punished adult → less imitation
Factors Contributing to Eliciting Aggressive Behaviors
Heat
“For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.” (Shakespeare, 1597)

Experimental example (Griffitt, 1970) 
Questionnaire, hot versus normal room temperature 
Hot room: more aggressive feelings, more hostility towards stranger

Field example (Kenrick & MacFarlane, 1986)
Phoenix, Arizona: Drivers without air-conditioning have been more likely to display road rage

Guns (Aggression Cue)
Prime hostile thoughts and punitive judgments
(Anderson et al., 1998; Dienstbier et al., 1998)

Experimental example
Guns & Shocks (Berkowitz & LePage, 1967)
Left over materials from former experiment
Guns vs. badminton rackets
Guns, more/higher electric shocks to opponent

Field example
Guns & the USA (Kellerman et al., 1993)
Having a gun at home, increased the likelihood of being murdered 2.7 times (controlled for gender, race, age, neighborhood).
Reduction of Aggression?
Catharsis Theory
Catharsis in relation to aggression:
The hypothesis that expressing aggression in an acceptable way (e.g., punching ball, video games) lowers aggressive tendencies
(= “blowing of steam”)

No compelling evidence that it is true
(and dangerous as it might have the opposite effect)
Television
Households with TV (often more than one)
Norway 95 %; Germany, 95 %; Australia: 99.2 %

National Television Violence Study (1997, USA)
6 in 10 programs contain violence
People in fistfights go down, stand up and come back stronger
Violent scenes:
73 %: aggressor went unpunished
58 %: victim was not shown to experience pain
Children's program:
5%: violence had negative long-term consequences
66% of violence was depicted as funny

Age of 12:
8000 television murders
100 000 other violent acts
Television
Correlational studies
Physical aggression (Direct)
The more violent the content, the more aggressive the child (Eron, 1987, Turner et al., 1986)
Indirect aggression
(gossip, manipulation, exclusion)
The more indirect-aggression content, the more indirect aggression behavior shown (British female teenagers)

Experimental studies (e.g., Zillmann & Weaver, 1999)
Watching violent vs. non-violent movies on 4 consecutive days
5th day, violent movie condition, more hostile to the research assistant
Television
How does violent TV content lead to aggression?
Desensitization
Affective responses to an initially arousing stimulus decreases with repeated exposure
Social scripts (schemata)
How to act in a certain situation
Altered perception
Exaggeration of the frequency of real world violence
Priming
Activation of aggression-related ideas
(hostile explanations for others' behavior)
Violent Video Games
Aggressive Cognition
beliefs, attitudes, perception, expectations
Aggressive Affect
desensitization, increase of frustration levels
Physiological Arousal
increase in arousal, increase of frustration levels
Aggressive Behavior
behavior scripts
Prosocial Behavior
decreased empathy, less helping behavior

Methods
Social beliefs and judgments
The self
Attitudes
Persuasion
Conformity and obedience
Small groups
Social identity
Stereotypes and prejudice
Aggression
Helping/ Attraction
SPSSI Research Summary on Media Violence
(Anderson, Bushman, Donnerstein, Hummer, Warburton, 2015)
Portable multimedia devices → on average 7 hours a day engaging with media.
Series of tragic mass killings; media violence exposure may have been a contributing risk factor ???
Hundreds of scientific studies, hundreds of thousands of participants, wide range of empirical methods
In experimental studies, even brief exposure to media violence can
cause desensitization to real-world violence
increases in aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
decreases in empathy and helping behavior.
Cumulative effects over time
Habitual exposure produces relatively stable changes in personality traits, such as trait aggression.
Longitudinal research rule out plausible alternate explanations to these findings.
Media violence exposure is linked with 
physically hurting others,
using words to hurt others,
and deliberately damaging the relationships of others.
Links between violent media exposure and “real-world” violent behaviors such as 
assault, intimate partner violence, robbery, and gang fighting.

Prosocial media messages can lead to increases in empathy and helping behaviors, and decreases in aggressive behaviors.
The “Media”
Media:
TV/Game violence will not influence viewers!
Is there a debate?
“Hearing they do not hear”:… Cupit, 2016
Media: TV/Video violence will not influence viewers!
Media: Advertising will make people buy this!
30-second spot during this year’s Super Bowl will cost marketers $5 million.
Denial: Tobacco; climate change; gun violence; media violence
Rejection of the validity of all empirical research
Small number of academics who consistently produce findings or meta-analyses that contradict what most in the field equally consistently report
Allows media to represent findings as still under debate
and provide a hook for politicians or bureaucrats not wishing to respond to the implications of the mainstream findings

First years of babies:
Imitation is the number one source of learning
Basic behavioral conformity effects
Close perception-action relation
Fashion (Lifestyle)


Social norms are strong influences
Aggression and Gender
Stereotype: Men are more aggressive
Studies find evidence for this claim

Problem: Differences in aggression expression
direct, physical aggression versus
indirect, social aggression (gossip, manipulation, exclusion)
may underestimate women aggression as direct, physical aggression is easier to measure
